1) How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
    - Graceful degradation is the concept where some application will start with max technology and "gracefully" maintain functionality (reduced functionality) within suboptimal conditions. 
    Service Workers are a script that is run separate from the main web application that provides minimal functionality during situations where there is no internet connection.
    These two are related because service workers provides a way to maintain functionality while having a suboptimal condition (no internet) for the website to gracefully degrade to.
